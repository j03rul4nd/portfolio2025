		Most developers either understand industrial complexity or modern web development—rarely both. I discovered early in my career that this gap creates massive opportunities for those who can bridge it. What started as curiosity about how industrial systems work has evolved into a unique expertise that sits at the intersection of heavy industry and cutting-edge web technologies.
	</p>

	<p>
		My journey began in industrial R&D, where I spent over 3 years solving problems that most developers never encounter: real-time data streams from industrial sensors, 3D visualizations that must perform flawlessly in mission-critical environments, and systems that literally can't afford to fail. Working at Becolve Digital on the GISize product family, I developed everything from smart city geospatial intelligence platforms to automated workflow schedulers that improved operational efficiency by 40%.

		The breakthrough came when I realized the future belongs to products that combine industrial-grade reliability with consumer-grade user experience. This led me to master rapid MVP development with modern stacks—not just to build faster, but to create solutions that are both robust enough for industrial use and elegant enough for mainstream adoption. Whether it's reducing deployment time by 80% through CI/CD optimization or building applications that serve 10K+ concurrent users, I've learned that the best solutions make complex problems feel effortless.
	</p>

	<p>
		Today, I architect digital solutions that transform industrial operations while maintaining the agility of modern product development. My work spans from real-time 3D systems using Three.js and WebAssembly to scalable SaaS platforms built with .NET and TypeScript. I've built everything from 3D terrain viewers using NASA SRTM data to custom QR code generators with interactive visualization—each project teaching me something new about the intersection of performance, user experience, and technical innovation.
	</p>

	<p>
		What drives me is the belief that the most impactful products are born from understanding both the complexity of real-world problems and the elegance of simple solutions. My approach is straightforward: dive deep into the complex problem, then make the solution feel effortless. Whether you need a rapid MVP to validate your concept or a complex industrial solution that scales, I bring the technical expertise and product vision to bridge the gap between what's possible and what's practical.
