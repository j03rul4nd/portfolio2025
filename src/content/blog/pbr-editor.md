# How I Turned a Problem into a Solution: The Story Behind the PBR Editor Online

**Introduction**

In the world of software development and 3D design, challenges are abundant. For me, each one represents an opportunityâ€”a chance to show that ideas can be transformed into real, impactful solutions. This article is not just about how I created the **PBR Editor Online**, but also a way to demonstrate to CTOs, CEOs, and recruiters how my skills can help turn their needs into functional, scalable, and effective products.

## The Need Behind the PBR Editor Online

It all started with a problem I faced personally. As a developer and 3D design enthusiast, I often worked with PBR (Physically Based Rendering) textures, essential for adding realism to 3D models. However, finding an efficient way to quickly preview or edit them was a constant challenge.

The problem was clear:

1. Existing tools were heavy, hard to use, or required advanced hardware setups.
2. For small or agile projects, it was inefficient to spend hours configuring tools just to evaluate textures.
3. There was no simple, fast, web-based solution.

Thatâ€™s when I realized this frustration wasnâ€™t unique to me. Many developers, 3D artists, and companies could benefit from a more straightforward approach. With that idea in mind, I started the project.

## The Process: From an Idea to a Functional Product

Creating the PBR Editor Online was a journey of constant learning, and the development process involved several key steps:

### 1. Defining the Objectives

The first step was straightforward: the tool needed to be simple, accessible, and functional. This meant focusing on:

- An intuitive design that anyone could master within minutes.
- The ability to load textures and see results in real-time.
- The possibility of generating maps like normals or displacement directly from basic images.

### 2. Choosing the Right Technology

Since the solution had to be accessible from any browser, I chose **Three.js** for 3D visualization. Its flexibility and ability to handle advanced graphics allowed me to build a rendering engine that was not only functional but also visually appealing.

The backend was intentionally minimal, using **Node.js**, while the frontend was developed with **Vite** to maximize loading speed. The entire project was hosted on **Vercel**, ensuring it was scalable and globally accessible.


### 3. Tackling Technical Challenges

The development wasnâ€™t without its hurdles. Implementing custom shaders to accurately represent textures was one of the most critical aspects. Ensuring that real-time adjustments were smooth and precise required optimizing every part of the code, from texture loading to graphic processing.

Yet, every obstacle became an opportunity to refine my skills and deepen my understanding. This is what I love about development: the ability to solve problems and turn abstract ideas into tangible tools.

## The Outcome: A Product in Action

The **PBR Editor Online** is now a functional tool that allows users to load, edit, and preview PBR textures directly from their browser. Its accessible design makes it ideal for:

- Developers who want to quickly evaluate textures before integrating them into a project.
- 3D artists who need an agile tool for quick adjustments.
- Agile teams seeking efficient solutions without relying on heavy software.
