## Solving a Real Problem with Advanced Technology

This project was born out of a personal need: to plan my off-piste skiing trip to **Niseko, Japan**. I faced a significant challenge: the available maps were neither accurate nor detailed enough to ensure my safety in the more challenging areas of the mountain. Leveraging my knowledge in web development and 3D technology, I decided to create my own solution.

## Innovation and Future Vision

One of the most exciting features of **Create 3D Terrain Maps** is its potential for continuous evolution. I am working on integrating artificial intelligence to predict avalanches and advanced topographical data visualization.

How do I plan to achieve this? In other projects, I have developed physical simulations in 3D environments that allow for collisions and complex physics to be applied to models. My idea is to extend these capabilities to 3D terrains, analyzing particle behavior under simulated topographical conditions.
